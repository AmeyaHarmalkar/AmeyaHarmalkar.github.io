>##  Teaching Assistant, ChemBE 630
**Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics and Kinetics**
*Johns Hopkins University, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering*

The core graduate course in Chemical Engineering deals with advanced concepts in Thermodynamics, phase equilibria, statistical mechanics perspective of thermodynamics and its applications in chemical and biological systems. The course is offered to incoming PhD students in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University.


>##  Teaching Assistant, ChemBE 409
**Modeling, Dynamics and Control of Chemical and Biological Systems**
*Johns Hopkins University, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering*

The courses deals with modeling, dynamics and control concepts for chemical reactions and process, and unsteady state analysis of biomolecular and chemical processes. The course is offered mainly to Seniors in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University. Model construction for biomolecular and cellular systems including pharmacokinetic modeling, biomolecular modeling using the central dogma of biology/control of gene expression, large scale biosimulation are major topics covered in the course. My job as a teaching assistant was to hold office hours, recitation sessions, proctor exams and assist students with analysis.
