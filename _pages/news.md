>## Review on advances in protein docking out in COSB!
**(December, 2020)**

My review on the recent advances in capturing backbone flexibility in protein docking is accepted in the Current Opinion in Structural Biology. The protein docking field has advanced tremedously in the past few years and we have tried our best to incorporate the recent advances. You can read the article here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2020.11.011" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/bibtex.png" title="bibtex" width="20px"/></a>.

>## Conference talks in RosettaCon 2020 and AICHE 2020
**(August, 2020 and November, 2020)**

I presented my work on Replica Exchange Monte Carlo with Induced-fit motions for sampling protein conformations while docking in RosettaCon 2020 and AICHE 2020. Although  virtual, it was a great experience to interact with known and new faces in academia and industry and incorporate their feedback in my work. 


>## Hiking the Northern Cascades
**Dragontail Peak, Leavenworth, WA (August, 2019)**

I attended my first Rosetta Conference in Seattle in 2019, and one of the fun things is engaging with conference attendes in an informal post-conference activity. Here's a quick snap with my advisor Prof. Gray and Dr. Sudhanshu, on the Aasgard Pass, at ~5400 ft elevation gain, exausted, yet mesmerized amidst the rocks of the Enchantments.
