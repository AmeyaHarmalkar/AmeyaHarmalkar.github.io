>## Modeling flexible protein-protein interactions

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) govern nearly all of the biological mechanisms, ranging from enzyme catalysis and inhibition to signaling and gene regulation. Understanding protein function and dynamics of binding is the key in delineating disease mechanisms, including CoVID-19, cystic fibriosis, Alzheimer's and even Cancer. The focus of my thesis research is to develop a computational tool for predicting interactions between proteins exhibiting significant structural change upon binding.

>## Protein engineering and design for exclusive receptor-ligand pairs

Joint research project in collaboration with Dr. Jamie Spangler and Dr. Warren Grayson.
The focus of this work to computationally identify plausible mutations on the protein receptor and ligand that can disrupt the interactions with wildtype and develop an orthogonal pair by evolving mutagenic libraries of the ligand.
